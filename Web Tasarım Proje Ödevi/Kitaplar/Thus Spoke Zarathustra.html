             <h6>It's a good thing Nietzsche created Zoroastrian, and fortunately Zoroastrian is on his way.
                Zoroastrians do not waste anything:
                It encourages and makes you think. It pokes and wakes you up. It makes you touch and feel...
                With this work, which blends literature and philosophy so beautifully and was created to mobilize humanity, everyone's path must cross paths with Zoroastrian for once!
                With the sentences in it; this book is a gateway to change the way you look at the world and perceive the world...
                "A goal is missing, humanity has no purpose yet," he says, and goes on the road for his purpose...
                At the age of thirty, Zoroastrian leaves his homeland and his heart and goes up to the mountains. There he enjoys his soul, his loneliness, and he never tires of it for ten years. But in the end, his heart changes, and what the poet said, "The world of the one whose heart changes changes."
                He clings to the road with the stars, Zoroastrian. Its purpose is to reach humanity and has built its path on "virtue" and "love".</h6>
             <h6>It drives humanity to love; First, he emphasizes that you have to start by loving yourself. "Learning to love yourself is not tomorrow's command. On the contrary, he is the thinnest, most awakened, the highest and patient of all arts." Because one endures oneself the most...</h6>
             <h6>A lot of people see zoroastrian on their way. But they either do not believe, or they despise or they make fun of. In fact, "no one hates you. They love you, they don't love you, they don't like you, go away from this city," he said.</h6>
             <h6>He talks about virtue, Zoroastrian. He says something little known: "To sleep without holes, one must have all the virtues." Because it says that the virtues that are made or possessed are hostile to sleep. "When you put your head on the pillow, are you comfortable?" he says briefly.
                Zoroastrian has a saying for many things; on the earth, on those who despise the body, on joys, on victories, on criminals, on neighborliness, on the day, on shadow, on reading and writing...
                "I hate wandering readers." That's what Zoroastrian says. Because the soul seeks; in writing and reading.
                Life is hard to bear, it's hard to shoulder life," he says, tying it in his finest words:
                "Of course we love life; But not because we want to live, not because we're used to it, but because we're used to loving it. Every love is a little crazy! It seems to me that the one who loves life is the one who loves life. Butterflies and soap bubbles are the ones who know happiness best among people." To see these volatile delicate, small bodies struggling; takes Zoroastrian to tears, to songs</h6>
             <h6>"I'm light enough to fly now, I'll see myself under myself."
                And that's how he says Zoroastrian.
                His heart is full of riddles; With sadness, their seas crossed the mountains, Zoroastrian.
                He was encouraging! It reminded me of climbing on your own head, even if you didn't have a ladder. He said that anyone who wants to see a lot of things has to learn to see beyond themselves. And he was only telling me with his eyes that the minister could see nothing but the front of the object. Zoroastrian's desire; to see the depth and façades of objects. That's why he said to mankind, "You must rise."
                "You have to go so high you have to see the stars underneath!""
                To reach your own height, you have to go deep first...
                And that's what he said, Zoroastrian.</h6>
