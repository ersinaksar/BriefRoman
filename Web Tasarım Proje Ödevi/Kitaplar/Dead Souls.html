             <h6>The main protagonist of the novel is Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, who stands out for his adventurousness and deception. Being rich is his dream, and he's capable of doing anything to make that dream come true. Pavel travels from town to town in Russia, buying peasants from landowners. But Chichikov has a different purpose; it's just buying slaves who are dead but not recorded. Since every landowner paid taxes for every slave at that time, they think they're making a profit by selling these already dead slaves for money, and they're happy. Pavel, on the other hand, puts hostages on this property that does not exist and receives money in return. It's a very profitable business. First of all, russia's N... he comes to your city. He introduces himself as the landowner. He gains everyone's admiration for his speech and manners. No one suspects him. He meets the elders of the city. Who are important people like the police, the governor, the prosecutor, the judge. He has evening meetings with these people, attends dinners. It creates the impression of a kind and respectful person in people.</h6>
             <h6>Then he take turns meeting with the ranchers. First he goes to Manilov's farming. This man is a pure man of faint character and quick blood. Pavel makes a good impression on Manilov. After dinner, Pavel asks about the number of villagers, especially those who appear to be alive but are dead. However, this question alarms Manilov at first, but he agrees to sell it after Pavel says he is paying taxes in vain. He doesn't get paid in return, citing their friendship. That would be a very lucrative job for our hero. Secondly, he talks to Ms. Koroboçka about the dead slaves they stayed the night with. The woman gets nervous at first, but in the conversation that goes on, she guarantees that she will shop at her farm, buying her dead slaves. Third, he talks to Nozdryev, a lying, drunken and unpopular landowner. When you say it was food, it was booze, it's dead slaves again. But this man is very alert. He asks why he bought these dead lives. Meanwhile, Pavel makes up a lie. He says he loves a girl very much, but his father won't give her up unless he has 300 slaves. Nozdryev pretends to believe, even if he doesn't.</h6>
             <h6>Meanwhile, Chichikov's purchase of slaves reads the gossip of the city. Everyone makes their own comments. No one understands why the villagers moved elsewhere. But there are words circulating that Chichikov is very rich, which is obviously in the interest of our hero. He is more loved for this situation. Women in particular have become pavel chichikov fans. The people in the city are already welcoming, and because they love Pavel so much, they want to host him more. That's why Pavel can't find a way to leave. He's very happy with the hospitality. Only then will an unfortunate event happen to him. At a party, Nozdryev suddenly comes into the hall and tells him that Pavel is a fraud and that he has bought dead lives. Everyone's shocked. No one understands why you buy dead lives. Some even say his goal is to kidnap the governor's daughter. He leaves town because of these situations.</h6>
             <h6>After this chapter, the book allows us to understand why Pavel is so greedy and dishonest. He had a bad childhood. He's an officer, and he learns how to make money with dead lives. After a series of events, his frauds are learned and go all the way to the Prince's ear. Pavel is imprisoned. He's saved by his friend. All your friend wants is for him to stop being a fraud. But this fraud has gone away all over the country.</h6>
             <h6>"I know that fraud cannot be eliminated with any punishment, measures and sanctions. Because the roots of forgery have been deep in our souls, and bribery has become a common right. Just as we are armed against the enemy, there is no way we can eliminate evil unless everyone understands that we must also rise up against dishonesty and dishonesty..."</h6>
