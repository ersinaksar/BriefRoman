             <h6>The story of The Hunchback of Notre Dame is set in paris in 1482. The people who started the day with the bells started the day in amazement when they thought that it was not an important day but that it was not a day of remembrance and that there was no celebration or execution day for that day.</h6>
             <h6>It is mentioned that there is a general method of celebrations since ancient times. During the celebrations, fires were first lit and then trees were planted in front of the church and the Palace of Justice. These celebrations, announced the day before, were announced by the mayor in a special outfit, and as the people who heard the bell started to head towards the designated celebratory area, everyone was heading towards the celebratory area, either to stop at the place where the fire was lit or to prepare to plant trees. Religious games and elections were being held for the President of the Madmen. In January, two celebrations take place on the same day. These celebrations are designated as King's Day and Mad Day. The public, on the other hand, saw watching the crowds at the doors and windows as a very enjoyable situation and they were watching them.</h6>
             <h6>Our writer, who started to explain what people see entering the hall, also shows that it is a lavish environment by talking about the details of everything. Games start with the exact twelve o'clock. The main reason the theater was at this hour was because it was the time when the Flemish ambassadors were coming. Our writer, who started to explain the groups in the hall, emphasizes that it is a very crowded hall. The book continues with the discussion of the conversations between the people and the sickening of the king between the people.</h6>
             <h6>In Notre Dame's Hunchback, the chapters continue in certain titles, while later pages mention that a gypsy abducted a child and replaced it with another. This child is an ugly, hunched child. Frollo begins to raise this baby, which was left at the door of the church. He tried to explain slavery and freedom with the sentences contained in the book. With the situation and his body becoming unbearable, a character has emerged who is now looking for himself more.</h6>
             <h6>As the book progressed, the fact that he was chosen as the ugliest man in a celebration and that he was going to ring the bells would not change the fact that. However, things started to take a different turn when Kuasimoda, his hunchback, saw Esmeralda and fell in love with her. Her big, warm heart in her ugly body made her fall in love with her when she saw her. But that girl didn't know there was a girl who'd been stolen and replaced before. The girl, on the other hand, continues her life completely unaware of her past. Kuasimoda, who succumbs to the love in you, plans to kidnap her and is caught kidnapping her. He's subjected to horrific torture. With the water she gives, it fuels the fire that falls into her even more.</h6>
             <h6>She loves someone else. In a plot, the girl kills a captain and, while she is to be executed, Kuasimoda kidnaps her again and takes her to church. According to tradition, no one can hurt her when she's in church, no matter what her crime is. Kuasimoda, on the other hand, clashes alone with everyone who comes to esmeralda's rescue and tries to protect her. Esmeralda, on the other hand, finds herself back where she's going to be executed while she tries to save him. Esmeralda, who was lynched to death there, was killed when her mother noticed her daughter and tried to save her, but it was too late. Because now Esmeralda is dead. Kuasimoda kills Esmeralda, who dies because of the priest.</h6>
