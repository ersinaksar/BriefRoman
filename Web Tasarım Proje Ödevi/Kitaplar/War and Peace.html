             <h6>As we read the novel, we see french words and phrases passing through the conversation. Although there are close to five hundred characters in War and Peace, it is especially told about the life journeys of five noble families that began in 1805. These families; Bezukovs, Bolkonskis, Rostovs, Kuragins and Drubetskoys. Although the Bezukovs are rich and noble, they are a fragmented family. The head of the family, Cyrillic Vladimirovic, is ill at the beginning of the novel and declares his illicit son Piyer his successor. He leaves all his assets to his son. This goes to the pain of many people. Because he's a lot of assets. Piyer is a big, brave man.</h6>
             <h6>They fall in love with Elen, who comes to the fore with her beauty at first. Then he doesn't like his behavior, he thinks he's vulgar. That's when Mason enters his organization and begins to live in his inner world. But in this agency, he doesn't find what he's hoping for later and he's disappointed. After his wife's death, he fell in love with Natasha and married her. The second family, Balkonskiler, is also an old and respected family. The head of the family, Andreyic Bolkonski, served in the army and was promoted to the rank of general. They have two children, Andrey and Marya. Andrey is a brave soldier. He marries Princess Lisa. Unfortunately, his wife dies in childbirth. He likes Natasha just like Piyer. But Andreyic Balkonski opposes this relationship and does not want to see it as his daughter-in-law. Andrey was severely wounded in battle and died. His sister, Maria Bolkonski, takes care of the son he left behind. Maria is an undated, even ugly girl. She is a woman who condones the insults and insults of her grumpy old father, but she is a moderate and loyal character. Despite all his father's actions, he won't let her go until he's dead. The Rostovs are a noble family living in Moscow. But lately they've been living a difficult life financially.</h6>
             <h6>That's why they're trying to get their children married to the children of rich people and get their finances in order. They have a son, Nikolas, and three daughters, Petya, Natasha and Vera. Nikolas is a very great patriotic young man. He's handsome. She and her cousin Sonya have a great love affair, but in the end, it's not what they want. Because her parents want a rich bride, she abandons her love and does what her parents want. He then fell in love with The Balconskis' devoted daughter Maria and married her. Natasha is one of the main and important characters of the novel. She's a crazy, cheerful girl. He's very affected by events and doesn't know exactly what he wants. He falls in love with Boris, Andrey, Anatol and Piyer. But at the end of the novel, he marries Piyer. The other important member of this family is their nephew Sonya. She's a poor girl, but she's very proud. He's in love with his cousin. But he also knows that his parents don't want him because he's poor.</h6>
             <h6>When the count of the family dies, things get complicated, and Sonya ends up with a letter. The Kuragin family is a highly controversial family. They have three sons. Elen, Anatol and Hippolyte. Anatol is a very handsome young man. He's a very extravagant and flirtatious young man. Elen, like her brother, is at the forefront of her beauty, and all men admire her.
