             <h6>Ismail is a lonely and lonely man who has spent his life at sea. Being on land didn't give him peace. He was used to the crazy tremors of the ocean. Walking in a flat piece like a curtain, breathing, seemed pointless to him. And he was going to go out to sea again soon to look for work on ships. But this time, the job he wanted was a little different.</h6>
             <h6>He wanted to be a whaling man. At that time, since the light bulb had not yet been invented, candles were used to illuminate the pitch blackness of the night. And, of course, the candle was made of whale oil. Anyway, whaling was one of the hardest jobs. Action at any moment, tension at any time. That's why Ismail wanted to be a whaler.</h6>
             <h6>Ismail, who was planning to stay in an inn on the evening he was staying in Bedford, was able to find a room in a ruined inn, but he had to share it with another man. Ismail, who did not see the man sleeping in the same bed in his darkness, was frightened and screamed when he saw a man of large size with interesting patterns on his face with the shadows hit by the candle. Ismail isn't the only one. He had the same reaction when he saw the guy with the interesting stripes all over his face, Queequeg. Queequeg was used to these reactions. So he was quietly curled up on one end of the bed. Ismail could barely sleep all night.</h6>
             <h6>By the next day, Ismail had gone to a church first thing because he wanted to spend his last days wandering around the city. And the church he went to was surprised to see him in Queequeg. He didn't think Queequeg was such a man, but the inn owner warned Ismail that he was a very kind and caring man.</h6>
             <h6>When Hana came back, she found Queequeg reading by the fireplace. He went up to her and started a conversation after she first apologized for last night. When he asked Queequeg if he could read or write, Queequeg told him he didn't know, and he even read the book to Ismail. And the friendships that were born with Queequeg started from here and became very tight.</h6>
             <h6>Ismail was able to see long after he set sail. Captain Ahab didn't have a leg. And that was because of Moby Dick, the legend of the oceans. Catching whales was the reason they sailed. The point was to kill Moby Dick, whom Captain Ahab was obsessed with. And since he put a huge prize money on the line, no one objected except First Officer Starbuck. They all gave up their lives by going after Moby Dick, the legend of the oceans, for revenge.</h6>
             <h6>Stuck in the past is a complete waste of time, that's a very accurate finding. We continue to suffer from the many pasts we have experienced in the past. The past may guide our present, but our present will guide our tomorrow. That was the biggest mistake Captain Ahab ever made. He's a whale and the most dangerous animal in the ocean. It's his nature to be a predator. Moby Dick had already escaped from Captain Ahab. Captain Ahab shouldn't have led the present of his past. His mistake cost many lives as well as his own.</h6>
