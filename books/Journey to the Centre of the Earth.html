             <h6>Journey to the Center of the World is one of Jules Verne's best science fiction and adventure books. Although there was not enough information and resources about submarines, space and sky at the time, it predicted many natural phenomena with its magnificent imagination and produced a perfect work. You will run from adventures to adventures. Journey to the Center of the World is a beautiful masterpiece to be read once you have it in your hand and you can't leave it unturned.</h6>
             <h6>Axel, the real protagonist of the story in The Journey to the Center of the World, is a young man who lives with his uncle. His uncle, Professor Liedenbrock, lives in an old hamburg neighborhood. The Professor, who is a professor at the university, is also a curious, non-giving investigative scientist. His life is full of books. And his uncle has a goddaughter. His uncle adopted this girl and became a very good family. They also have an assistant named Marta who works at home. Axel is in love with Gertrud, his uncle's goddaughter. Gertrud loves her very much, but they can't live love out of fear of their uncle. Axel will now tell his uncle that he is in love with Gertrud and inform him that they have decided to marry.</h6>
             <h6>On this code, the Professor decides to leave with tools, compasses and axes. Axel's sorry he's leaving Gertrud, but he can't go against his uncle. When he gets back, he'll marry Gertrud. After all the preparations have been made, Axel and the Professor sail long aboard to Iceland. All adventures begin after that. When they arrive in Iceland, they begin their adventure to reach the center of the world by taking hans, a local, with them for money. They'll be in a lot of trouble along the way. First they start with the caves and stay here longer than they anticipated. When the water in their canteen runs out, they find a waterfall of boiling water coming from the bottom of the ground and they avoid dying. Sometimes they walk downstream and sometimes they walk on their way. One day, axel dives into the cave and loses his way. After three days, they'll find him wounded. By the time they reach the end of the cave, they are at sea levels.</h6>
             <h6>They have to cross the sea and cross the coast. Hans builds a raft, and they sail the blanket. Winds, storms, whales, sharks arrive on an island after experiencing a lot of adventures. There's going to be a lot of incidents there, and they're going to rock again. When they reach the shore, they see that the place where they came from was the shore where they were before they sailed again. He's always been to the same place. They'll stay there for two days and think about it, and in the meantime, the professor will find a code. There's a path of cliffs. He thinks he's going to go down to the center of the world there. They blast the inside of the rock with dynamite and a waterfall is formed by squirting tons of water through the rock. Axel, Hans and the professor get caught in this current and go with the water for hours. All of a sudden, they find themselves in a tunnel, and the water here is getting hotter.</h6>
             <h6>After a while, it begins to boil. As the water boils, lava erupts and they realize they've fallen into a volcano. Their deaths are imminent. If the lava doesn't spray them out soon, they'll burn to death. After a while, the lava erupts and all three find themselves on Earth. They have not landed in the center of the world, but many of the methods they have tried along the way will guide the next generation and its technology. Once they've recovered, they'll go home. Axel Gertrud is terrified he'll never see him again, but having him in his arms right now is the centerpiece of Axel's world.</h6>
