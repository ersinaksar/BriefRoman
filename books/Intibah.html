Mr. Ali; In addition to his father's loving, gentle and caring state, he is angry, extremely ambitious and passionate. However, Mr. Ali has a positive side: he attaches great importance to his lessons. He built his whole world on his lessons. If he's going to make a sacrifice, it could be buying an expensive book. Or if she cries, she cries because she can't solve a difficult case in the book she reads. His father died when Mr. Ali was twenty. After his father's death, Mr. Ali is very upset and very impressed. He won't leave the house for days, he's completely withdrawn. It has lost many of its features for the past. His mother would be very upset about his son's condition. He's willing to give his life to get her back to the way she was. When the poor woman is looking for remedies, she finally convinces her son to take her out and walk her.

One day, he'll be back to his old sociality, go to the pen where he works and spend time with his friends.</h6>
             <h6>One day they decide to have a meeting with their friends. They choose Camlica for the meeting place. The street they go to is crowded, and most of the men on this street say that they love him very much, that they will die of love, even if it is a lie for their own amusement. Among them are Mr. Ali's friends, but Mr. Ali is not happy about the situation. He sits in a corner watching them and thinks he needs to keep up. Although not in accordance with the manners and wishes of his father, he approaches a car with this purpose. However, the curtain of the car is slightly opened, a sign that Mr. Ali does not know about is made and the curtain is closed. Mr. Irikilen Ali learns from his friends that this sign, which he does not know the meaning of, means "We cannot talk without diminishing strangers around." He feels like he's been slammed. For days, he thinks and imagines this decent lady in the car. In the end, he decides to go back to Camlica to find that lady. And when he does, the woman's car is there. When she gets out of the car, Mr. Ali freezes, he can't talk. Finally, the woman who can't stand it makes the first speech herself. Her name is Mahpeyker. Mahpeyker is the kind of player who's a liar, a fake, and he's going to rock the players. Mr. Ali doesn't realize that they're about to have a stampede with a bad lady.</h6>
             <h6>Mahpeyker, on the other hand, took Dilashub, whom Mr. Ali kicked out of the house, as a maid to his house and tortured the young girl variously. Mahpeyker, who still cannot win Back Mr. Ali, continues his evil plans and decides to kill Mr. Ali, following the advice of a friend who is just as bad as he is.
