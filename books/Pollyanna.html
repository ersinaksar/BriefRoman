             <h6>In a letter to her, Miss Polly Harrington learns that her nephew, whom she has never seen, is all alone and allows her to live with him. His assistant asks Nancy to prepare a room for her niece Pollyanna. Nancy fulfills what is said, prepares the room, but does not please the little girl at all with the preparation of this room in the attic. Mrs. Polly is one of the richest people in town, and she's got a big enough house. He couldn't understand why this tiny, unpretentious and very warm room was reserved for Pollynanna.</h6>
             <h6>Pollyanna gets disappointed when she goes up to her room. There are no carpets on the floor, no paintings and mirrors on the walls. As soon as he notices the view from the window, he is happy and stops worrying about the lack of paintings. Then he's glad there's no mirror where he can see the freckles on his face. Polyanna opens the window because the room is very hot, does not mind the flies that come in and climbs the huge tree in front of the glass. When he comes down, he starts running to get to the top of the rock across the street from the house. It's lunchtime, and Pollyanna tells her aunt Nancy, who's angry that she's still not here, to give her bread and milk as punishment. Unable to find Pollyanna, Nancy goes out into the garden and tells Mr. Tom that the little girl isn't home. Nancy sees him on the rocks and goes to get Pollyanna. She says her aunt was very angry with her and that dinner was bread and milk as punishment. Pollyanna says she's very happy about it because she loves bread and milk. She tells Nancy that she's happy about everything, and when she wants a baby, she talks about the crutches that come out of the relief crates. And he tells of this game started by his father, who says he should be glad he doesn't need crutches. Nancy would be happy to say she'd be in this game.</h6>
             <h6>A woman in black all the time wears a blue collar that day and tells her aunt to pass it on to Pollyanna. Another asks him to convey that he will not be separated from his wife, the other is no longer sad, another is happy with his remaining two teeth, that he is happy for Ms. Snow's holding hands and that he is knitting blankets, and so the examples multiply. And he'd be more than happy to know that Jimmy's living with Mr. Pendleton. Not understanding some of the narratives, Ms. Polly asks Nancy what this game is. Nancy tells him about this game that starts with crutches and tells her that almost the whole town is playing. When Mrs. Polly goes to Pollyanna and tells her that she's playing this game now, Pollyanna's very happy.</h6>
             <h6>Although Dr. Chilton can't visit Pollyanna, he's monitoring her condition and one day asks Mr. Pendleton for help examining her. Dr Chilton, who was once dating Ms. Polly, says she can't leave without being called, fearing Polly's reaction, but mentions a doctor friend who will make Pollyanna walk. Upon hearing this, Jimmy tells Mrs. Polly what he's heard and tells her that pollyanna might walk. Mrs. Polly asks Dr. Mean to call Dr. Chilton. Pollyanna is so happy to see Dr. Chilton, she doesn't even care about her legs. Her aunt tells Pollyanna that she's going on a trip next week, going to see a doctor who heals people like her.</h6>
             <h6>He sends a letter to his aunt from where he's been treated for ten months. "Now I can walk, I can walk! I went from bed to the window today. Six steps. It's so nice to be able to walk! ''</h6>
