             <h6>Bazarov and his friend Arkadiy finish university and leave for their village. Arkadiy's family is where they're going first. Afterwards, the two friends planned to visit Bazarov's family together.</h6>
             <h6>Arkadiy's father Nikolay Petrovic and uncle Pavel Petrovic, who live a traditional life and live within certain principles in their own way, are irrational to bazarov's every thought. Pavel Petrovic, an aristocrat and aristocrat who had all the characteristics of the Russian aristocrats of the time, clearly hated Bazarov, but he saw him as a rival and could not tolerate his presence. However, the fact that Arkadiy's father lived with a very, very young woman and they had a child who was not even a year old outside of weddhood, but he could not share any of this with his son Arkadiy, the shame of this shows that this traditionalist family is not afraid to take radical steps.</h6>
             <h6>In the novel, we see Arkadiy defending Bazarov's thoughts, and he makes it clear. But Arkadiy's can't go beyond just one influence. While Bazarov also used nihilism to analyze life, Arkadiy cannot come up with ideas about it. Later in the novel, Bazarov's love for a woman named Anna Sergeyevna, Arkadiy's deep love for Anna and then his younger sister Katerina, as well as the tidal feelings of these two friends, the conflicts of opinion between them, try to tell us this. Nihilism will be over for arkadiy as he confronts the aspects that are very suitable for this traditional life. But for Bazarov, it's not a trend. It's a way of life. And there's no room for love in the life he chooses, even if it's unrequited.</h6>
             <h6>Bazarov even took his own death as too commonplace. He tells his father that he accidentally cut off his hand while examining the body of someone who died of typhoid, that he was infected with the disease and that he would soon die. "It's a very old fact, death, but it's new to everyone," he says.</h6>
             <h6>Turgenyev's valuable work can be examined in many respects, especially nihilism. The way his mother and father's love for Bazarov was processed, the pain of the son was well explained by Bazarov's death. Arkadiy and Bazarov's families assessed the situation of landowners in Russia at the time and made references to the Russian people's overview of life. We also find the perspectives of the men of the time with their comments to a woman and the Anna-Katerina brothers that Bazarov and Arkadiy met on the occasion of the ball they attended in the city: <br> <br> “... If a woman can continue a half-hour conversation, that's a good sign." <br> “... Let her be a woman and not be cunning." <br>“... From what I've seen, free thinkers among women are only the ugliest." </h6>
             <h6>“... No matter how passionate, sinful, rebellious a heart lies in this grave, the flowers that grow on it still look at us with their innocent eyes docile, calm: they talk not only about eternal peace, nature's "indifferent", great peace, but also immortal peace, eternal life..." (Last sentence of the book)</h6>
