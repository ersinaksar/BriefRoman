             <h6>The Count of Monte Kristo is the work of the French writer Alexandre Dumas, which was first published in the year. The Count of Monte Kristo, which received great attention during its publication years, is still considered an ancient classic today. The work, which has an enormous fiction and is written in extremely fluent language, has been the subject of many adaptations including movies, series and cartoons. For me, too, it was a book I read with pleasure and always wondering about the next page. I should also point out that the Count of Monte Kristo is one of the most fluid and best classics I have ever read. This book, written many years ago, takes the reader back to the period when it was written. I think it's a book that people who like to read novels should read. I would also recommend the author's other books, The Three Musketeers, Black Tulip and Iron Mask.</h6>
             <h6>The book begins with the return of Edmond Dantes, a young sailor from Marseille. It's been a very difficult time for Edmond and a campaign that has had consequences that make him happy. Because the beloved first officer of the ship he worked for fell ill and died during the expedition, and Edmond was his successor before he died. Danglars, the ship's accountant who couldn't film Edmond becoming the new captain, is the only one on board who's jealous of his happiness. The entire remaining crew loves Edmond very much, and no one has questioned why he's the new captain.</h6>
             <h6>When Edmond returns to his town, he sees that his elderly father, Dantes, and his mouthpiece, Mercedes, are waiting for him with great longing. Only his father is exhausted and sick. According to his father, his neighbors Kadrus asked his father for his debts after Edmond left, and the proud father, Dantes, starved to death when he paid off the debt with a large portion of the money his son left him. Mercedes came to see him every day, but his pride kept old dad Dantes from asking his future daughter for help. Edmond runs to his fiancée's house after catching up with his father. Mercedes' parents died a while ago. His only relative is his uncle's son, Fernand.</h6>
             <h6>Fernand is in love with Mercedes and tries to convince her to marry him, but Mercedes does not think for a moment about cheating on Edmond or breaking up with him. Fernand is there when Edmond excitedly enters mercedes' house. After embracing the Mercedes, Edmond reaches out to Fernand for a handshake, but he doesn't get a response. Fernand rushes himself out of the house. Meanwhile, danglars and Kadrus, two villains whom fate introduced to each other, sit together in a coffee shop just ahead. What unites them is their jealousy and hatred for Edmond. Kadrus followed Edmond to his fiancée's house, where he met Danglars, another person who hated and envied Edmond.</h6>
             <h6>They know Fernand hates him, too, so they want to use it to bring him to an end. By nightfall, the three of them would drink together and fuel each other's anger. Kadrus, who found free drinks, was drunk, but Danglars and Fernand were conscious enough to set Edmond up. Danglars enters Fernand's mind and prints him a letter of notice. According to this letter, Edmond Dantes is a traitor. Written with jealousy and hatred, this letter will shake Dantes' life.</h6>
