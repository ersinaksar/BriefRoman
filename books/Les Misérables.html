             <h6>Jan Valjean is a poor peasant, sentenced to rowing for a loaf of bread he stole to feed his family, repeatedly attempted to escape, and after nineteen years in prison, he lost his faith and was released with anger and hatred for society. In the town of "D", where he came in miserable form, his soul is illuminated by the kindness he receives from the bishop of the town.</h6>

Suspecting Valjean's hidden past, Detective Javert investigates and reaches the theft in the town of "D". However, due to the similarity of the name, another was arrested in place of Jan Valjean, and the matter is closed.

However, after an argument, Maryus left her grandfather's house and stayed at the Sen-Jak hotel for a while. In order not to be indebted, Maryus leaves the hotel and moves to his friend Kurfeyrak's room, where he completes his training and becomes a lawyer. One day, Maryus sees Kozet wandering around the Luxembourg park and falls in love with her at first sight and comes to this park to see her every day. Noticing the relationship between Maryus and Kozet, Jan Valjan does not want this relationship and moves out of the house where they lived. But Maryus finds them again, and Maryus and Kozet meet in secret.</h6>
