             <h6>Tom Sawyer lives in the town of St. Ptersburg with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid and Polly's daughter Mary. Tom is famous for his mischief. No matter how much Aunt Polly loves him, she still can't help but be angry.Tom has a girlfriend named Amy, but Becky, who just moved into town, has stolen Tom's heart.</h6>
             <h6>Bored Tom encounters huck, the town's most unpopular boy, while he's walking around, and Huck has a dead cat. The two cronies become friends and decide to go to the cemetery with the cat during the full moon because they believe the dead cat saved them from warts. While in the cemetery, they hear voices from the darkness and see Muf Potter, indian co and Dr. Robinson, one of the most notorious bandits in town, digging a grave. When bandits ask Dr. Robinson for money, a fight breaks out. Unexpectedly, the Indian hits Co Potter and Potter loves it. Co stabs the doctor in the heart and puts the knife in Potter's hand. Potter also admitted that he committed the murder because of the effect of being already drunk when he awoke. Terrified children ran from the scene.</h6>
             <h6>Tom is not happy at home. It's really frustrating that he and Becky are having a bad time. Tom is determined to get away from here and become a great man. Huck and I decided to become pirates, and they took Joe Harper, Tom's best friend, with them, and left in a dinghy to the island in the middle of the night. After days passed, the whole town believed that these children had drowned in the river and, with great sadness, decided to hold a funeral. Tom wonders who's upset behind him and goes home in the middle of the night. Saddened by his aunt's devastation, Tom returns to the island and the three children, fed up with the island conditions, decide to return. They go to a funeral at the church on Sunday. At first everyone is very happy, but then they get very angry. Tom gets so cool at school and everyone starts respecting him. Except for one person, this person is none other than Becky. Becky envys Tom's close relationship with Amy, and she begins to get close to another child. While all this is happening, muf potter's case is seen. Tom, who also tried to help Muf Potter in prison, loses his conscience and tells him everything he sees in court, risking his life. The Indian is sentenced to death, but the Indian escapes. Tom's fearful days have begun.</h6>
             <h6>Joe and his friend don't show up, and things stall a little bit. Tom reconciles with Becky and they go on a picnic led by Becky's family. Tom and Becky disappear through the caves. All the children are cradled into the ferry and returned to town. Because the children say they will stay with their friends, their mother only notices their absence the next day. Everyone starts looking for two losses. Children try to find an exit in the cave, but the despair that overwhelms them with hunger and thirst is eating away at the children. Tom sees Indian Joe as he searches for an exit through the cave's holes. It'll make things more difficult. Then they find a way out when the children are about to die. When they get back to town, everyone welcomes them. The whole town would love it. Becky's father has all the entrances to the cave sealed off with iron. Tom then says that Joe the Indian is inside. When they go to the cave, they find Indian Joe's lifeless body. Tom feels sorry for the thug who, despite the peace of mind of being safe, lives without food or water, thinking about his own experiences. Tom thinks of Joe's gold and money. He and Huck share it and decide to go to the cave and remove the treasure. They take ropes and candles with them so they don't get lost. When they found the Indian symbol and dug it up, they got their gold. Now both are rich.</h6>
             <h6>Tom Sawyer is the child hero that Mark Twain brought to the art world and inspired many works over the years. This work, which appeals to both children and elders at the same time, is the kind of work that everyone can find from themselves. We see clearly how innocent and reckless childhood is, that the best memories of man can accumulate in childhood, and what true friendship is throughout the journey. If you miss the hot summer days and joyful moments of your childhood, this journey will be very good.</h6>
