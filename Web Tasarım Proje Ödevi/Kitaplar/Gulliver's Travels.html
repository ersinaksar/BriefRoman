             <h6>The author finds himself in the middle of a storm. His ship disintegrates and lands half-starved, half-unconscious. It's surrounded by people who are too young to suddenly understand the language. They're afraid of the Author and look around to see if there's more. The author suddenly finds himself a giant. Everything around him is too small for him. When writing Jonathan Swift's book, he suggests that he criticized people's ego and human behavior in the different geographies in which he lived.</h6>
             <h6>The author's character is captured. It provides information on people and countries in the area where he was captured. These dwarves must jump in front of the queen to jump positions. The country is divided into two parties. There are also two countries in the world. People believe in the shape of the world like trays. The death of the dead is very interesting. Since the end of the world will end in reverse, when that day comes, they are buried vertically to stand. This double belief can be interpreted as a sense of competition and a kind of heavenly hell affair. The only difference, according to Jonathan Swift, is that in the world of money and position, it is grouped as "partisan" or "not partisan."</h6>
             <h6>The author must meet certain conditions in order to be released. In a way, in this world where she knows nothing, she has to pledge allegiance to the rules of a queen and a society to which she does not belong, rather to the queen.</h6>
             <h6>After the author is released, there's a fire. Rabelais, who slammed clergymen and hypocritical politicians from the ground up in a Renaissance transitional work, extinguishes that fire with his giant urine, as in Gargantua. Things aren't going to go so well at this point. On top of that, the country's anti-giant politicians, who think they're going to run out of food, are in a series of preparations.</h6>
             <h6>The hourglass for the author is almost over. I wonder what he should do. And what happens if the warships of the other country engulf the country? Jonathan Swift answers many questions in a stinging manner in his first episode. In the second part, the situation is reversed. The author comes to a place where there are people who are many times larger than him. Here, he's a slave to a man compared to his old journey.</h6>
             <h6>Last Word from Jonathan Swift:

                "It is no less pleasure to think that my work may not face any criticism."</h6>
