             <h6>I would say that Tolstoy's distinctive spelling language is quite dominant and is written with incredible skill. To be honest, it really impressed me. But like any classic, Anna Karenina has long paragraphs that may seem boring to the reader. Therefore, I would advise those who wish to read Anna Karenina to read not the full text but one of the other abbreviated and edited editions. But if you have read such long classical works before, you should definitely choose to read the full text in order to enjoy the work. The book compares two relationships, one honest and publicly approved, and the other forbidden and morally low. The inner world and moods of the characters are very well reflected to the reader. Events are generally between Moscow and Petersburg. As for the brief summary of the story:</h6>
             <h6>Anna Karenina is a very beautiful russian lady who lives in Moscow and is elegant enough to make the viewers jealous. He is married to Alexis Alexandrovitch, who holds a high office in a government office, and has a son. While Anna doesn't like her husband, she thinks she's a robot devoid of all emotions. Therefore, they have a passionless relationship based solely on respect.</h6>
             <h6>Anna Karenina leaves for her brother Stephane Arcadievitch, who lives in St. Petersburg. Because it turns out that your brother cheated on his wife Dolly, and Dolly is about to leave her husband. Anna is on her way to St. Petersburg to reconcile the couple. And he does that. Stephane Arcadievitch and Dolly are back to the way they were.</h6>
             <h6>During an event in St. Petersburg, Anna met a handsome young gentleman named Count Wronsky. Wronsky was very impressed with Anna, like everyone else who invited her, and Anna liked Wronsky very much. However, Wronsky is said to be interested in Stephane Arcadievitch's sister-in-law Kitty. Levine, who was also a close friend of Stephane Arcadievitch, was also a suitor for Kitty, but Kitty turned down Levine's proposal, under the influence of her mother, Princess Cherbatzky. The princess wants her daughter Kitty to marry Wronsky, who is a soldier and whose future looks bright, not Levine, who lives in a rich but a village. Kitty was also influenced by her mother.</h6>
             <h6>Anna and Count Wronsky have a growing bond. They attend all the invitations and spend a lot of time together, regardless of the looks of the people around them. All society speaks of them, but they are both blinded by happiness. But after a while, Anna became uncomfortable. She decides to end this relationship before it begins and sets off to return home. But Wronsky doesn't want to leave, he's under Anna's spell. He gets on the train anna's on and goes after his love. He doesn't know what might happen to him in the future, what might happen to him because of his love.</h6>
             <h6>I think it's a book that lovers of classical reading should definitely read. I don't think it's a slow-moving book, as you'd expect from a classic, but a very fluid one. And I must add that the full text of the book is 1048 pages. I also leave the introduction to the book here in the hope that you will like it as much as I do, "Happy families are alike. Every unhappy family has its own unhappiness."</h6>
