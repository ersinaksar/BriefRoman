             <h6>Oliver's tragic story begins with an unknown woman giving birth in the House of the Weak. He gets the first kick of life at birth. She's named after the doctor who gave birth to her on her feet. He lived in a church nursing home in poverty until he was 10. When Mr. Bumble, the director of the House of the Weak, turns 10, he picks him up and brings him back to his birthplace. But it doesn't take long. He's kind of a slave when he's being punished for asking for extra porridge.</h6>
             <h6>Mr. Sowerberry reaches out to a friend after five days. This guy who's a funeral leper is taking Oliver. But that's not Oliver's salvation. On the contrary, it takes a sadder and more dangerous path. After what's been said about his mother, he gets into a fight with Noah, who uses Oliver as his apprentice and constantly torments him. But the lady and daughter of the house get involved, and the three of them get together and beat Oliver up. It's locked in the cellar for a few days. He's on his way to London, where Oliver, who plans to escape in the cellar, hears his name a few times on his first opportunity.</h6>
             <h6>He can't stand it any longer in a village on the way to London, and he loves it. He tells the villagers what happened, collects some food with their help and moves on. Hapless Oliver's path crosses with a man named John. He trusts her when I tell her you can buy her dinner and escort her to London. That idea changes when you start 1000,000 people 100,000 miles from the narrow streets to the dirty neighborhoods. John's dragging him into a gang of pickpockets.</h6>
             <h6>The pickpocketing gang robs an old man and it's on Oliver. But the old man looks at Oliver's pure face and thinks there's a job involved. When Oliver faints, he takes her home. He'll have a brief happy time with Mr Brownlow and Mrs Bedwin, Oliver. He shares his whole life story with them. Although he remains happy with them for a short period of time, Mr. Fagin and the others will haunt him. They'll kidnap him.</h6>
             <h6>Nancy in the gang, who's also on bad plans, no longer wants to hurt Oliver, so she goes to the hotel to tell Mrs. Maylie everything. Since he wasn't there at the time, he'll tell Rosa everything he knows. They plan to meet in the middle of the night, but Nancy can't come because she's afraid she's being watched. Meanwhile, Oliver and Rosa visit Mr Brownlow and Mrs Bedwin to thank them for all. He tells you everything he's been through, Oliver. Mr. Grimwig regretted not trusting him and thinking he was a thief. The next Sunday, Nancy gets her boyfriend, Bill, drunk and goes on a date, but charley, not Bill, is behind it.</h6>
             <h6>Charley gets all he hears to Fagin and Bill. Bill gets so angry, he goes home and beats Nancy up, he's so angry, he doesn't even know he's dead. Then he runs away. Mr. Brownlow and Rosa go to the police and tell them all the facts.</h6>
             <h6>Mr. Brownlow gets Mr. Bumble kicked out of the House of the Weak, Edward cashes in all his assets and goes to America, but when he gambles and robs, he's sentenced to life in prison. Mr. Fagin is captured and imprisoned, Charley regrets everything he's done, puts aside his old life, starts working for a farmer. Mr. Brownlow adopts Oliver. After all, the ordeal of Oliver's life is over.</h6>
