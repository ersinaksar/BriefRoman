             <h6>Robinson Crusoe is the third and youngest son of a very wealthy family. He was raised spoiled because he was the youngest. His parents want him to be a lawyer, but he wants to be a marine. Despite all his father's warnings and objections, he boards a ship bound for London, dreaming of sailing and travelling the world. However, due to the storms, the journey does not go as he hopes. As a result of a severe storm, they are forced to leave the ship in a small dinghy. With the help of the people of the city, they go to London. He'll take a second trip when he should be learning from it.</h6>
             <h6>The ship is attacked by a pirate ship somewhere between the Canary Islands and the African coast and they are captured. He was a gardener for two years at the Captain's house where he was captured. He and a black friend get in a dinghy and run away. When they run out of food and water in the dinghy, they have to disembark. A Portuguese ship bound for Brazil picks them up. After four years working in a factory in Brazil, he boarded a ship bound for Africa. The ship is caught in a very violent storm. It slips into a small dinghy with the crews, but a big wave turns the dinghy upside down. He starts swimming with all his might, reaches the shore. He can't see anyone around.</h6>
             <h6>He spends the night in a tree, and the next day, when the waters recede, he climbs on board with the help of a rope. Food from the ship, pieces of wood, anything you can use. He finds a toolbox. He climbs a hill, he examines the surroundings. This is an island, and there are no people but Robinson Crusoe. He builds himself a cabin with the supplies he brings from the ship. It carries items from the ship for twelve days, but the ship disappears as a result of the storm. It makes a safer and more stable hut due to the wild animals around it, and a tent for its supplies.</h6>
             <h6>Twenty-three years later, on one of his expeditions, he sees black people sitting around the fire on the island, anxious for days. As he wanders around the island, he sees a Spanish ship sinking, and he immediately collects supplies that will come in handy. Thirty locals come to the beach one morning in six boats. They have a prisoner, he tries to escape from the black prisoners, Robinson saves the prisoner with his Crusoe rifle, the run away in fear. He calls his prisoner Friday and trains him.</h6>
             <h6>Months later, three dinghies arrive, a white prisoner of negroes. With Friday, they'll save the prisoner. They'll save Friday's father in the boat. The white man and Friday's father leave the island to rescue the other prisoners, then take Robinson Crusoe and Friday. It'll take days, but no one's coming.</h6>
             <h6>Eight days later, three prisoners arrive on the island with eight men. Robinson Crusoe secretly talks to one of the captives and learns that he is the captain of the ship that is docked in the future, and agrees with him to take him on board. With Friday's help, they save the prisoners. By Friday, he would board the ship and return to England after 35 years. He stayed on the island for 28 years.</h6>
